    <h2>Background Information</h2>

    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>
        Upon its founding, board member Bill Siemering said that NPR “will serve the individual: 
        it will promote personal growth; it will regard the individual differences among men with 
        respect and joy rather than derision and hate; it will celebrate the human experience as 
        infinitely varied rather than vacuous and banal; it will encourage a sense of active 
        constructive participation, rather than apathetic helplessness.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, NPR’s mission is to provide information to the public, “fostering a deeper 
        understanding and appreciation of events, ideas, and cultures.” NPR’s nationwide member 
        stations share in this mission, covering about 99% of the United States within its 
        broadcast reach. NPR and its member stations follow a public media model, prioritizing 
        public access, collaboration, and non-commercial storytelling (NPR, 2019).
    </p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
Following the adoption of the 1967 Public Broadcasting Act, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting created National Public Radio (NPR) in 1970 along with the Public Broadcasting Service. NPR centralizes member stations’ governance and serves as an engine for “newsgathering, production, and program-distribution.” NPR established an open archive in 1972, which includes 120,000 hours of broadcasts stored on physical media. NPR’s goal is to grant access in perpetuity via their digitization efforts. NPR was an early entrant to the internet: NPR established NPR.org in 1994 and introduced audio-streaming in 1996. With over ten million listeners and one thousand member stations, NPR has expanded beyond traditional radio to distribute music, news, and podcasts. In 2013, NPR relaunched its homepage to revitalize the user experience across platforms, and works with both internal and external teams to further develop the site. In coordination with Squarespace, NPR optimized playback of longform videos directly on the homepage (NPR, 2019; Institute of Education Sciences, n.d.; Congressional Research Service, 2025).
    </p>

    <h3>Reporting Strategy</h3>
    <p>
        Member stations serve as the foundation of NPR’s reporting strategy, providing diverse 
        journalism rooted in local communities. This allows NPR as a whole to “tell the story of 
        the whole country from everywhere in the country.” The NPR website is a reflection of this, 
        featuring dedicated reporting initiatives like the “Local Stories Project” to highlight 
        regional journalism adapted to suit a larger audience. NPR’s website is not only a source 
        for a national audience, but a global one as well. NPR.org is the platform where this 
        regionally-sourced journalism is sourced, published, made widely available, and archived.
    </p>

    <h3>Technology Plan</h3>
    <p>
NPR’s digital platform supports its mission of providing high-quality journalism across multiple formats. NPR.org is central to its technology plan, with an adaptive design and localized sites. By integrating member station partnerships on its digital platform, NPR can implement its national fundraising efforts and interconnected digital strategy. The Digital Media team has used agile methods in its platform development and scrum methodology, even  expanding beyond its software development to use Agile in its broader business practices (Johnson, 2012).
    </p>

    <h3>Why Did We Choose NPR.org?</h3>
    <p>
 We chose to analyze NPR.org because of its history as the United States’ public radio network and a reputable news source. We are interested in exploring NPR’s digital platform as an extension of its history and diverse slate of news and cultural programming. Particularly at 
a point when funding public media has been the subject of governmental discourse, we want to 
analyze how NPR delivers content to the American public, and how NPR.org’s digital platform supports its overall mission.

	<h2>The Local and National NPR Sites</h2>
	<p style="color:gray"> "Every day, NPR connects with millions of Americans on the air, online, and in person to explore the news, ideas, and what it means to be human. Through its network of member stations, NPR makes local stories national, national stories local, and global stories personal... The links between NPR and Member Stations are many and deep. At the core, we share a mission to inform the public, increase understanding of the world and enrich the experience of everyday life. Every day, NPR and its Member stations work together to tell the story of the whole country from everywhere in the country” (NPR,2019). </p>

	<h3>Local NPR Stations</h3>
	<p> Local stations broadcast local talk and radio shows and cover local news and issues. Member stations are locally owned and independent stations that pay annual licensing fees to NPR. They are a part of the NPR mission to “ collaborate with Member Stations to cultivate an informed public, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas, and cultures.” </p>
	<p>NPR.org provides a station finder feature to help users easily locate stations around the country.</p>
	<h3>The National NPR Station</h3>
	<p>NPR's national entity presents reports on national and international news stories. They report on topics such as politics, culture, health, business, etc.
The main NPR website has information to connect users to member stations around the country. NPR’s national network produces its own content that is often aired by its member stations, including shows such as Morning Edition and All Things Considered.</p>

<br>
<br>

    <h2>Usability Test of the National NPR.org Website</h2>
    <p>
Within the context of systems analysis, our team created a use case for a typical NPR.org        user who views the site as a trusted news source and uses the site to access breaking global news.
    </p>

    <h3>Use Case: View breaking news headlines from Mexico</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scope:</strong> NPR.org website</li>
        <li><strong>Level:</strong> User-goal</li>
        <li><strong>Actor:</strong> United States-based general news reader</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Stakeholders & Interests</h4>
    <p>
The news reader is the primary actor in this use case, who wants an efficient and navigable path to access breaking news headlines from Mexico. This user may prefer to access multimedia options, and also may want to access the headlines from a mobile device as well as a computer. 

There are several other stakeholders in this use case with diverse but converging interests:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The NPR Editorial team wants to present trustworthy reporting organized in an easy-to-find format.</li>
        <li>NPR’s IT team/UX designers want a smooth experience across devices, quickly-loading pages, intuitive navigation to global and regional headlines, and clean design and metadata.</li>
        <li>Content management administrators want correct categorization/content tagging of web pages related to Mexico with efficiency in publishing breaking news stories.</li>
        <li>Additional stakeholders include journalists and advertisers, with additional interests including accessibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Goal</h4>
    <p>To quickly access current news from Mexico.</p>

    <h4>Preconditions</h4>
    <p>The user must be on a device connected to the internet and the NPR.org website must be working.</p>

    <h4>Trigger</h4>
    <p>The user visits NPR.org with the intent to view headlines from Mexico.</p>

    <h4>Main Success Scenario</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>User opens NPR.org on their device.</li>
        <li>NPR.org loads, and navigation header is visible.</li>
        <li>User selects “World” and “Latin America” from the “News” dropdown.</li>
        <li>System displays a mixture of stories from Latin America, with clickable headlines and images.</li>
        <li>User scans the headlines for stories specifically from Mexico.</li>
        <li>Once clicked, a story on its own page is loaded by the system, including text, audio, and video.</li>
        <li>User ingests the content within the story.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Alternative Flows</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2a.</strong> NPR.org is slow to load → user refreshes the page.</li>
        <li><strong>2a.</strong> A pop-up requests a donation → user exits the pop-up. </li>
        <li><strong>3a.</strong> User uses the search bar and enters “Mexico breaking stories” to directly reach Mexico-specific headlines.</li>
    </ul>

<br>
<br>

	<h2>Human Computer Interaction</h2>
	<h3>Consistency</h3>
		<p> NPR has a very consistent design across its website. Their colorful logo and local affliate's logo are shown in the top left corner on every page. The donate button is in the top left corner and is in red which draws in the user's eye. This is indicative of the political situation and NPR loosing its federal funding which is making them have more need for user's funds.<br>
	The live radio button floats in the top right hand corner, even when you scroll. This pushes NPR's orginal mission of their radio programming. The website has increased their reach and given users a different way to engage with their content, beyond FM radio. Many people do not use radio often so this is a new avenue.<br><br><img src="https://joseph-cl.github.io/cualisjoseph/OnAir.png" alt="NPR On Air Widget" height="200";"><br><br>
	News stories are formatted the same way across topics  (topic listed, title in large bolded letters, the date published, the author of the article, a header image, and then the full text) which allows users to have a sense of consistency between stories. If there is an audio recording of the article, a large blue “listen” button is displayed before the header image with options to listen now, read a transcript, or add it to a playlist. There is even an option for downloading an audio clib for offline listening.<br><br> <img src="https://joseph-cl.github.io/cualisjoseph/article.png" alt="NPR Article" height="300";"> <br> </p>
	<h3>Attention</h3>
		<p>NPR uses a consistent pallete of colors across the website. Any colors outside of black and white are used to draw the user's attention to specific parts of the website.</p>
	<h3>Search Function</h3>
		<p> The search functions uses mainly a keyword search with options to narrow the search via if it was heard on the radio, dates, or from a specific news show. The search gives the number of results for each search and how long it took to find those results on the page.<br><br> <img src="https://joseph-cl.github.io/cualisjoseph/Search.png" alt="NPR Search Box" height="100";"> </p>
	<h3>Multiculturality</h3>
		<p>NPR is upfront about the organization's ethics, code of conduct, opportunity for public comments, and corrections. Their connect section and about NPR section have direct links to these parts of the website. Their ethics handbook outlines multiple guidelines that all of their employees use. In the guideline "Be considerate of community norms," NPR says that employees need to “Realize that different communities – online and offline – have their own culture, etiquette, and norms, and be respectful of them. Our ethics don't change in different circumstances, but our decisions might. The foundation of respect in reporting on any community is awareness. Strive to be knowledgeable about the culture, and be attuned to gaps in your understanding. Often your colleagues can be a terrific resource to help you get up to speed on unfamiliar settings.” (NPR, 2021). </p>
	<h3>Limitations</h3>
	<p> Basing this critique on Nielsen's Usability Heuristics, the cite is very well set up with a few issues that hinder accessibility.</p>
	<h4>Nielsen's Heuristic 7</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Limited filter and sorting options for search results (mostly basic best match/relevancy, newest result, oldest result)</li>
		<li>Browsing articles cannot be customized to the user</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Niesen's Heuristic 9</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>FAQ on how to use the website is not easily identifiable (NPR, 225b). </li>
		<li>If search yields no results, no recommendations for how to remedy. issue</li>
	</ul>
	<p>(Nielsen, 2024).

<br>
<br>

	<h2>Recommendations</h2>
	<p>Overall, NPR’s website is well done. Our recommendations for better accessibility are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Issue</th>
			<th>Recommended Solution</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>English is the only language natively available on NPR.org.</td>
			<td>Include a translation option to a variety of languages at a visible location at the top of the webpage.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Only one font style and size option unless you use outside programs. Hinders readability for some users.</td>
			<td>Multiple font size and style options should be offered in an accessibility menu on every page</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>	<td>The "text only" accessibility option is buried at the bottom of the webpage in the site map.</td>
			<td>Move the "text only" option to a more visible part of the page, maybe in an accessibility menu.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>There is not much prompting for where to look for assistance when a user encounters an error. The FAQ and help page is buried within the site map in the "Contact and Help" section.</td>
			<td>The website should link the FAQ/Help page in the error message and have it as part of the main website navigation. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Filtering options in the search are extremely limited and relies mostly on the user to put in effort to scrub through the search results.</td>
			<td>Provide more comprehensive filtering and/or an advanced search option in NPR's native search function.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

<br>
<br>
	<h2>Conclusions</h2>
	<p>NPR has a really strong brand that is recognizable among many differnet types of users. There appears to have been a lot of care put into making the site usable by people with many different abilities. Most of our recommendations center on making the accessible features of the site more visible and increase the opportunities for user feedback.</p>
