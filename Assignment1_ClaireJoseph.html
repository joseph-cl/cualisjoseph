	<h2><br>NMNH Context and Background</h2>
	<p>The National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) states their mission is to, “promote understanding of the natural world and our place in it.” They do this by collecting and storing specimens from the natural world and conducting research to explore and better understand the earth.<br>
NMNH’s collections cover every continent and are distilled into larger categories of Anthropology, Botany, Entomology, Invertebrate Zoology, Mineral Sciences, Paleobiology, and Vertebrate Zoology. The museum has the largest natural history collection in the world with over 148 million objects and specimens. The search site is fairly simple stylistically, with tabs within each category search allowing for different ways to find records. It does appear that the museum is part of the way through a digital modernization process as some links in the collection search take you to a more modern version of the NMNH website.</p>

	<h2><br>NMNH Online Catalog System Users</h2>
	<p>The NMNH online records search system is primarily geared towards researchers because the system requires a relatively high level of knowledge about the subject being searched for. The digital collections in this system do not seem to be for casual browsing of the collection but for more focused research.</p>

	<h2><br>Content of NMNH's System</h2>
	<p>NMNH’s online search system currently lists <b>11.3 million specimen records</b> (~7% of the full collection) with about 10% of the online records having georeference data. When clicking into a record, the catalog number, sub-collection, specimen count, geolocation of source, notes, a specific link to the record, and any category specific information (example: For a meteorite sample, the name, type of meteorite, weight, and find/fall information would be included. For specimens of living things, information such as scientific name, classification, common name, and who identified the specimen are also included in the record). Items in the collection include research logs, museum ledgers, photographs of specimens (taxidermy, bones, etc.), etchings of specimens among many other things. Some records include many images of items and some only include ledger information.</p>

	<h2><br>Discussion</h2>
	<p>The NMNH digital collections support a lot of granular metadata that is very important when requesting to gain access to certain specimens for further study. You can clearly see that the system is meant for serious researchers who want to be able to use the resources that the museum has to offer. The digitization program is still in development and is an ongoing process for the museum. The digital collections system is their own data catalog but they also publish data aggregates on other sites that are widely used by researchers around the world such as GBIF and iDigBio.<br>
The NMNH system appears to have a high level of quality control and all records appear to be fairly robust. I am very impressed with the amount of data each record holds, even when the digitized item is not necessarily detailed on its own. Even for the records that only include a ledger, all the information about that item is digitized. It appears that these records will be updated with photos of the specimen itself and more notes about its condition.</p>

	<h2><br>Pros and Cons of the NMNH Online Catalog</h2>
	<h3>Pros</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Very detailed records.</li>
		<li>Intuitive system if you know what you are looking for.</li>
		<li>Stable links provided for each record.</li>
		<li>Many opportunities for filtering results in search.</li>
		<li>A few quick browse curated options.</li>
		<li>Can view search results as a list view or gallery view.</li>
		<li>Clicking on a record opens a popup of the record with photos.</li>
		<li>Can download a list of search results as a csv.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Cons</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Not easy to explore collection if not an expert in the field.</li>
		<li>Many records do not include photos of the item itself.</li>
		<li>Out of date appearance.</li>
		<li>Many links bring you back to the main NMNH site which is a completely different look. It is difficult to get back to the search page.</li>
		<li>Controls to navigate the record search are unlabeled.</li>
		<li>Pages of the search sometimes glitch and no records appear.</li>
		<li>Even if records have specimen pictures, it is not always the image that shows up in the gallery view.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a more intuitive browsing system through options such as more curated digital specimen collections for visitors to browse through.</li>
		<li>Have pictures of specimen as default picture in gallery view.</li>
		<li>The tabs showing search/file path should keep you on the search website instead of redirecting to NMNH's main, modern site.</li>
		<li>Include labels on the buttons/options in search results.</li>
		<li>Include pictures in records when you download search results as a csv.</li>
