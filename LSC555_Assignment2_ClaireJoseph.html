	<h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Visibility of System Status:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Has a brief buffering circle when conducting 					keyword searches, it's barely perceptable.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Match between system and the real world:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Uses similar set up to library database, with 					search bar towards the top and filters on the left</li>
					<li>The layout of search results is similar to that of 					other journal databases (by dates, volumes, issues, 					dates).</li>
					<li>Does not have options for any languages other than 					English.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>User control and freedom to be able to undo/redo actions easily 			and correct mistakes easily:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>When you click on a search result, there is a 					button that allows you to return to the results 					list.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Consistency and standards:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>When in a particular issue's entry, it shows your 					path to that issue, similar to a file explorer on a 					computer.</li>
					<li>All entries have the same format for titling and 					metadata entry.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Error prevention:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>No correction for spelling mistakes but does ask 					users to check spelling if no results come up.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Recognition rather than recall:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>The buttons are consistent across searches and 					results.</li>
					<li>Search keywords are saved so users can go back to 					them easily.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Flexibility and efficiency:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>If users are signed in, they can save items to 					their account to return to later.</li>
					<li>Shortcuts to collections of Tower issues, separated 					by year, are on the system's homepage.</li>
					<li>There are options for sorting results by 						"relevancy," "Title (a-z)," "Newest," or "Oldest."</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Aesthetic and minimalist design:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>The layout of system is similar to that of other 					library databases. JSTOR is also a very common system 					in academic spaces so it should feel familiar to many 					users.</li>
					<li>There are only a few colors used for filters on 					some screens, and the colors are consistant with 					Catholic University's branding.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Any results that do not yield search results, give 					suggestions on how to fix your search terms such as 					spelling errors and clearing filters.</li>
					<li><img src="https://joseph-cl.github.io/cualisjoseph/NoResults.png" alt="No results page when search did not yield any results" width="250"></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Help and documentation:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>There is a small button for "search help" on the 					main system page that links to JSTOR's general search 					help page. This link is also recommended when 						there are any search errors.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
		<h4>Strengths</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>There is very little lag and the response time is typically 				very quick.</li>
				<li>Within search results, there are options to search within 				those results. Doing so immediately adds Boolean operators to 				the search.</li>
				<li><img src="https://joseph-cl.github.io/cualisjoseph/Searchwithin.png" alt="Search within results search box" width="250"><img src="https://joseph-cl.github.io/cualisjoseph/Boolean.png" alt="Boolean term added to search bar" width="250"></li>
			</ul>
		<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Older issues also do not seem to register as having 				specific text so they are not easily searchable.</li>
				<li>The filter options are very limited which hinders attempts 				to narrow search results</li>

	<br>
	<br>

	<h2>Summary of Analyses</h2>
	<p>The Tower archives system looks appealing and has good functionality for browsing but has some major issues with more focused searches. Both the heuristics analysis and the usability test found that though the Tower archive system looks appealing and is easy to browse, there are some major issues in the search functionality. The search function is unreliable and not usable for research for most of the archived issues. The issues are in different states of readability by the system, with older issues being scans and newer issues having digital content and increased integration with online systems.
One the plus side there are very few issues with the system speed and responsiveness, with most tasks happening almost instantaneously. This means that user frustration may mostly come from limited functionality rather than impatience, which if the search function is tweaked, frustration will be minimal.</p>
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<h2>Recommendations</h2>
	<p>From the results of the system analysis, it is recommended that The Tower Archives increase metadata information and computer-text compatability across issues. A way to achieve this is by creating typed versions of each issue readily available alongside the digitized physical editions so that the system can more easily index the text, thus making the search function better. Another option, or another element to add in addition to the first option, is to add tags of topics covered in each issue so that more filters will be available in searches and keyword searching will be more precise. These options do call for intensive time and labor to achieve but as of right now, the system is not super usable for research, unless the user knows exactly which issues to look at.</p>
